Assignment 2: Buffer Manager
============================


Description
-----------

For the second programming assignment, you will design and implement a buffer manager that handles page management for a database system. The buffer manager will allow pages to be loaded, locked, and accessed concurrently by multiple threads. The core functionality of the buffer manager includes fetching pages from disk, storing them in memory, managing page replacement using the 2Q caching policy, and ensuring efficient thread-safe access to pages. Your implementation should support concurrency and ensure the correct reading and writing of pages to disk.

This assignment involves a fair amount of code, and we **strongly recommend** starting early to ensure sufficient time for debugging and testing.


Key Requirements
-------------------------------

Locks and Concurrency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use `std::shared_mutex` via `FrameLockTable` to handle shared/exclusive access to pages. Pages locked in shared mode can be accessed by multiple readers, while exclusive locks are required for write access.
- When fixing a page, increment the use counter to track how many threads are accessing the page. Decrement this counter when the page is unfixed.
- Ensure that locks are held for the shortest possible duration, especially during disk I/O operations, to improve concurrency.

2Q Replacement Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Pages start in the FIFO queue when first loaded into memory. If they are accessed again while still in the FIFO queue, they are moved to the LRU queue.
- When evicting pages, attempt to evict pages from the FIFO queue first. If all FIFO pages are still in use, eviction should occur from the LRU queue.
- Dirty pages (modified pages) must be written back to disk before eviction. This operation should be done under an exclusive lock.

BufferFrame Dirty Flag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Modified pages should be marked as dirty. Dirty pages must be written to disk when evicted to prevent data loss. Track when a page is modified and handle the flushing of dirty pages during eviction.


Implementation Overview
-----------

We provide skeleton code required to implement the buffer manager. The lab is structured into a modular layout, separating interfaces (headers) and implementation. You will complete your implementation entirely within the `src/buffer/buffer_manager.cpp` file. All header files located in the `src/include/` directory are read-only and contain the definitions of the classes and methods you must implement. The key classes include:

- **Page**: A simple wrapper around a fixed-size page (4096 bytes) of raw memory. This is the basic unit of storage managed by the buffer manager.

- **BufferFrame**: This class handles individual pages. It stores metadata such as page IDs, dirty flags, and whether the page is locked exclusively. A frame stores exactly one single page. If a page is "pinned", that means it's undergoing some operation (read/write) and it cannot be removed from a cache. However, it does not directly manage concurrency or page eviction.

- **BufferManager**: This class controls concurrency, page replacement, and the 2Q page replacement strategy. It is responsible for managing shared and exclusive locks, page eviction, and fixing/unfixing pages. You will implement these operations, ensuring proper thread safety and efficient page access.

- **PageGuard**: An RAII wrapper that manages the lifecycle of a fixed page. When a `PageGuard` goes out of scope, it unfixes the page and releases the lock via `unfix_page`. This design prevents resource leaks and simplifies error handling.

- **Policy**: An interface for page replacement policies. The provided `TwoQPolicy` class skeleton needs to be completed to implement the 2Q caching strategy, managing FIFO and LRU queues to determine which pages to evict.


Implementation Details
--------------------

The `fix_page` and `unfix_page` methods are the core of your buffer manager implementation. `unfix_page` is called from the `PageGuard` RAII wrapper. Here's a high-level guide for implementing the key methods.

`fix_page(page_id, exclusive)`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** Retrieves a page from the buffer pool, loading it from disk if necessary, and locks it for either shared (read) or exclusive (write) access. This mechanism ensures controlled, concurrent access to pages in a multi-threaded environment.

**Parameters:**

1. page_id: The unique identifier of the page to be accessed.
2. exclusive: Determines the lock mode: 

    true: Locks the page exclusively for write operations.

    false: Locks the page in shared mode for read operations.

**Returns:** A `PageGuard` object that wraps the `BufferFrame`. The guard automatically unfixes the page when it goes out of scope.

**Steps to follow:**

1. **Check if Page is in Memory**:
    - If the page is already in the buffer pool, update its access info in the policy.
    - Lock the page (shared or exclusive) and increment the use counter.
    - Return a `PageGuard` wrapping the frame.

2. **Page Not Found in Memory**:
    - If the page is not in memory, find a free slot in the buffer pool.
    - If the buffer is full, get an eviction candidate from the policy.
    - Ensure that the eviction process is thread-safe.

3. **Load Page from Disk**:
    - Load the page from disk using `StorageManager`.
    - Add the new page to the policy.
    - Initialize frame metadata (e.g., page ID, lock, use count).

4. **Lock the Page**:
    - Lock the page based on the requested access type (shared or exclusive).
    - If the page is locked in shared mode, multiple threads may access it concurrently. If locked exclusively, only one thread may access it.
    - Increment the use counter for the page.

5. **Write Back Dirty Pages**:
    - If evicting a dirty page (i.e., a modified page), write it back to disk before removing it from memory.
    - Remove the page from the policy.

`unfix_page(page, is_dirty)` (Private Method)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** This method is called automatically by the `PageGuard` destructor when a page guard goes out of scope. You typically won't call this method directly. It releases a previously fixed page from the buffer pool, updating its status based on whether it was modified.

**Parameters:**

1. page: The page to be unfixed.
2. is_dirty: Indicates whether the page was modified during its fixed period:

    true: The page was modified and should be marked as dirty

    false: The page remains unmodified.

**Steps to follow:**

1. **Mark Page as Dirty**:
    - If `is_dirty` is true, mark the frame as dirty so it will be written to disk before eviction.

2. **Decrement Use Counter**:
    - Atomically decrement the use counter for the page. If the counter reaches zero, the page can potentially be evicted.

3. **Unlock the Page**:
    - Release the lock on the frame via `FrameLockTable` (shared or exclusive, based on how it was originally locked).

`PageGuard`
~~~~~~~~~~~

The `PageGuard` class follows the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern. When you call `fix_page()`, you receive a `PageGuard` object. **You are required to implement the PageGuard constructor, destructor, move constructor, and move assignment operator.**

.. code-block:: cpp

    {
        auto guard = buffer_manager.fix_page(page_id, false);
        // Access page data
        uint64_t* data = reinterpret_cast<uint64_t*>(guard->page_data.get());
        // if data is modified, mark the guard as dirty
        guard.setDirty();
    }  // guard goes out of scope here -> page is unfixed

Key properties to implement for `PageGuard`:

- **Constructor**: Must initialize the guard with a `BufferManager` instance and the target `BufferFrame`.
- **Automatic unfixing via Destructor**: No need to manually call `unfix_page()`. The `PageGuard`'s destructor **must** automatically call `BufferManager::unfix_page(...)` to ensure the frame's use counter is decremented and locks are released properly.
- **Move semantics**: Guards can be moved but not copied, ensuring single ownership. You must implement the move constructor and move assignment operator to cleanly transfer ownership of the underlying page pointer without triggering an accidental `unfix_page` on the old moved-from object.
- **Exception safety**: Even if an exception is thrown, the page will be properly unfixed.
- **Explicit dirty marking**: Call `guard.setDirty()` when you modify the page.


Implementation Clarifications
----------------------

- FrameID: It can be treated as an identifier or index for a BufferFrame.
- **FrameLockTable**: The `FrameLockTable` is responsible for providing fine-grained synchronization at the frame level. Instead of using a single giant lock for the entire buffer pool (which would destroy concurrency), you must use `FrameLockTable::lock_shared(FrameID)`, `lock_exclusive(FrameID)`, and corresponding unlock methods to protect individual `BufferFrame`s while they are pinned in memory. For instance, when `fix_page` retrieves a frame, it should acquire the appropriate lock using `FrameLockTable` before returning the `PageGuard`. When `unfix_page` is called, the lock should be released.
- Use `StorageManager` methods to load or flush pages when necessary.
- Policy class: The provided `TwoQPolicy` class needs to be completed. It manages the FIFO and LRU queues and determines eviction candidates.

- Buffer eviction policy:

  1. Evict from **FIFO queue** first.
  2. If no evictable pages in FIFO, then evict from **LRU queue**.
  3. If neither queue has evictable pages (all pages are pinned), you must throw a **buffer_full_error**.

- 2Q policy Implementation:

  - First access of a page: Page enters **FIFO queue**.
  - Second access while in FIFO: Page is promoted to **LRU queue**.
  - Subsequent accesses in LRU: Page is moved to the end of the **LRU vector**, which represents the most recently used position.
  - The total number of pages across both queues must be less than or equal to **MAX_PAGES_IN_MEMORY**.


Implementation Guidelines
----------------------

- Ensure thread-safety by properly managing locks and atomic operations. You need read locks for reads and write locks for modifications to avoid concurrency issues.
- It is fine to use a coarse lock to synchronize access to class-level variables, but you must use `FrameLockTable` to ensure fine-grained read/write synchronization for pinned frames.
- Don't miss to consistently update any auxiliary data structures you create.


General Guidelines
----------------------

- We encourage you to complete the single-threaded implementation before moving to multi-threaded test cases.
- Your implementation should pass all tests. Tests with `Multithread` in their names have a timeout to prevent deadlocks from blocking the testing process.
- Passing earlier tests doesn't guarantee correctness. Later cases might expose deeper flaws in eviction and synchronization logic.
- **Note:** Gradescope will run a few hidden tests in addition to the provided tests. Ensure your implementation is robust and handles all cases correctly.


Building the Code
-----------------

We have provided a `Makefile` to simplify the build process. You can build the code with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    make clean && make

Make sure that your project compiles without any warnings, as we treat warnings as errors. The compilation will produce an executable in the `build/` directory.


Testing the Code
-----------------

To run a particular test case, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./build/lab2.out <test_number>

For example, `./build/lab2.out 2` runs the second test case. If no test number is provided, all test cases will be executed one by one.
